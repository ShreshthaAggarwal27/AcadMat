# ACADMAT - Bridging the Gap in Academic Resources

## Overview
ACADMAT is a web platform aimed at fostering resource sharing within the education sector. Our mission is to connect individuals who have surplus academic resources with those who need them the most. By repurposing unused items like books, school bags, uniforms, and other educational materials, we aim to make education more accessible and equitable for all learners.
